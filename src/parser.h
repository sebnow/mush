 \brief Initialize a list of commands by parsing an input string
 
 The string \a inputLine is parsed to separate the various commands. Each
 \c command_t is pushed onto a FIFO queue. The first command is therefore at the
 top of the queue.
 
 \param inputLine string of input to be parsed
 \return queue of \c command_t objects
